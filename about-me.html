      <p>My name is Keaton Gunn, and this is a little bit about me. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="base">  
      <p>I was born and raised in Winnipeg by my mom, Shelley, and my dad, Geoff. I also have a younger sister named Kailey, and a 6-year-old golden retriever dog named Jax, who I would argue is the best dog in the world. My hobbies include playing video games, watching movies, playing/watching hockey, and playing golf. </p>

      <p class="about">I chose to enroll in the Software Development program at MITT around January of 2021 after being laid off from my job in the auto body industry and came to the conclusion that I wanted to seek further education in the software field. This program at MITT seemed like a perfect fit because I can either use what I learn to find a career, or further expand my education down the road if I choose to do so. </p>
      <p class="about">Technology has always interested me, and i tent to be my familyâ€™s go-to tech support person when their devices (inevitably) start to have problems. My favorite part of technology has to be how it is ever-changing. It grows and evolves based on societies (knowing or unknowing) wants and needs. I guess you could say I am passionate about technology. Some of my other passions include the Winnipeg Jets - our local NHL Team, video games, specifically Call of Duty, and going to the movies. Thankfully, theaters are now open and I can freely see movies whenever I have the time. I also love to play golf, my Dad got me started when I was very young and golfing with him is one of my favorite pastimes.</p>
      <p class="about">To summarize, I am a sport-loving movie nerd who would love to succeed in the technology/software industry, and I am confident that the Software Development Program at MITT is a step in the right direction.</p>
