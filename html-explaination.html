      <h2>HTML & CSS</h2>
      <p>HTML is a standard markup language used in creating websites that tells a website what to do when it is loaded. It uses elements and attributes to provide a basic skeleton that will show up on a webpage in order on the left-hand side. CSS goes hand in hand with this by providing it with rules that tell each portion of the HTML document how to display on the webpage. For example, if HTML is the skeleton of a webpage, CSS is all of the unique features that make people different from one another. </p>
      <img src="./html-css-1.webp" alt="A top-down image of a notepad, a laptop and a book with 'HTML&CSS' on the cover">
    </div>
    <div class="html-body">
      <h2>HTML Basics</h2>
      <p>HTML elements are everything from start to end in an HTML document. It often defines sections or lets you display certain portions of your webpage in different ways. For example, in order to write this paragraph, a common way of doing this would be to use the 'p' tag. I would put 'p' at the beginning to specify that is the start of a paragraph, and I would use '/p' to state that is the end of a paragraph. Using a forward slash within an element always specifies the end of that element. I also used an 'h1' at the top of this webpage to specify that it was the header element of the webpage. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="attributes"> 
      <h2>Attributes</h2>
      <p>Certain HTML elements can use attributes to provide additional information about that element. I like to think it helps describe that element and make it more specific. You will always want to use this in the starting element. A great example is the 'img' tag. One way to use an image on a webpage is by using the 'img' tag and placing the source “src” attribute to provide a location within your computer of the image you would like to display.</p>

      <h2>Css Basics</h2>
      <p>Now that you have a skeleton of a webpage, you need to make it look how you want it to. This is where CSS comes in. For example, let’s say I would want to make the font of this paragraph blue. I would use p { to specify that I want to alter the <p> element, and I would use the color: blue; rule to specify that I want to make the content blue.</p>

      <h2>In Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Using HTML and CSS, there are almost limitless possibilities to explore when creating a webpage, and I hope this was a helping hand to get you on your way.</p>
