      <h2>How to Catch a Pokemon</h2>
      <img src="./pikachu-1774508_960_720.jpg" alt="An image of pichu, a yellow mouse pokemon">
      <p>If you are new to pokemon, one of the most important tasks in the game is learning how to catch pokemon. Having a variety of pokemon on your team will make the game more enjoyable, and overall make it feel more rewarding.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="areas">
      <h2>Areas</h2>
      <p>There are three main areas you can find pokemon. They consist of grass, caves, and water.</p>
      <div class="area-table">
        <table>
          <thead>
            <th>Water</th>
            <th>Grass</th>
            <th>Caves</th>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>You will mostly find water type and flying type pokemon in water.</td>
              <td>The widest variety of pokemon appear in grass.</td>
              <td>Mostly rock and ground pokemon live in caves.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Lakes can be found around the region, or a route may consist of all water.</td>
              <td>Very common, found on most routes.</td>
              <td>Mostly found as a passage between routes.</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="ball">
      <h2>Pokeballs</h2>
      <p>In order to catch pokemon, you must first buy pokeballs. Pokeballs are found at poke-marts. When thrown at a pokemon, they will have a percentage chance of being caught depending on what pokemon it is and the damage and status effects caused to that pokemon. More damage done, and a status effect will equate to a greater chance of catching the pokemon.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="mart">
      <h2>How to Buy Pokeballs</h2>
      <ol class="list">
        <li>Find a poke-mart (building with blue roof)</li>
        <li>Talk to the clerk (behind the counter)</li>
        <li>Select pokeballs from the poke-mart menu</li>
        <li>Select quantity, and confirm purchase</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="catching">
      <h2>Catching the Pokemon</h2>
      <ol class="list">
        <li>Use attacking moves to weaken itâ€™s HP (Hit Points) as low as possible. You will know it is weak when its HP indicator bar is red.</li>
        <li>(Optional) You can apply a status effect such as paralysis, freezing, or putting it to sleep to improve your chances of catching the pokemon.</li>
        <li>Go into your bag and select a pokeball to use</li>
        <li>The pokeball will roll 3 times before an animation plays letting you know you have successfully caught it. Although it is not guaranteed, so it may take you many tries depending on the catch rate of that pokemon</li>
        <li>Once caught, it will record its information in the pokedex (basically a pokemon encyclopedia) and it will ask you if you would like to give it a nick-name</li>
        <li>Success!</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Although Pokemon games are more in-depth than they may appear, this will get you set on the right path to success.</p>
